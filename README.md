### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an <b> Economist </b> in training.

I am interested in the sustainable financing of African public services. This is motivated by research on the water industry and health spending in Kenya, and advocacy for disabled women's social protection.

### My work

My passion project is <a href = "https://tagnal.shinyapps.io/femicideke/">  Femicide Count Kenya </a>
